#Condition

The conditoinal statemnets in JavaScript help make decisons easier based on certain conditions. The condition specified in the statement can be wither true or false. The code with the conditional state,nets executs on if true. 
Their are 4 types of conditinaal statemnets:


## if statement 

1. An if statement executes a specified code segment if the given condition is ''true.''

```js
var age = 22
//condition is, age bigger or equal to 21 
if (age>=18) {
    //if condition is met
    eligibility = "Congrats! You can vote"
}
```
----
## else statement 

2. An else statement executes the code associated with the else if the given if condition is ''false.''

```js
var age = 22
//condition is, age bigger or equal to 21 
if (age>=18) {
    //if condition is met
    eligibility = "Congrats! You can vote"
}
```
----
## else if statement 

3. An else if statement specifies a new condition for testing when the first if condition is ''false.''

```js
var age = 22
//condition is, age bigger or equal to 21 
if (age>=18) {
    //if condition is met
    eligibility = "Congrats! You can vote"
}
```
----
## switch-case statement 

4. A switch-case statement specifies multiple alternative code blocks for execution and executes these cases based on certain conditions.

```js
var age = 22
//condition is, age bigger or equal to 21 
if (age>=18) {
    //if condition is met
    eligibility = "Congrats! You can vote"
}
```
